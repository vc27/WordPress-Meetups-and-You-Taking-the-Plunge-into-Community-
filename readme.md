## WordPress Meetups and You, Taking the Plunge into Community!

We're all a part of some Meetup group somewhere and if you're not you probably will be soon. Learn how to take the quick and easy plunge of setting up an event in your city or town. Learn about the official WordPress Meetup Chapter program and a brief look at community driving WordPress Nashville.

Some of **you** are natural born organizers, most of **us** are not!

### What is a Meetup?

An informal meeting or gathering.

- Meetup groups are locally-organized groups that get together for face-to-face events on a regular basis (commonly once a month).
- Anything that brings together 2 or more people to share their WordPress experiences counts.

##### What can a meetup look like?

- presentations / lecture series
- hackathons
- social gatherings
- workshops
- coworking
- running a WordPress help desk
- contributor sprints/drives

### WordPress Meetups specifically

It's different in different cities. Some meetups have gone under the chapter program and some have not. You'll always know which groups are under the chapter program because WordPress will be an organizer.

##### Meetup.com Chapter Program
- https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/
- The "WordPres" meetup account owns the actual meetup group. So in Nashville's case we handed the account over to WordPress.
- WordPress meetup groups that are part of the Chapter Program receive certain benefits, including having the meetup.com dues paid by the WordPress Foundation.
- We are also able to make requests, with in reason and require approval, to benefit the group.

Having a meetup group on this account does require following a few good-faith rules that were created by a group of volunteer meetup organizers:

- Meetups are to benefit of the community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
- Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
- Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and shouldnâ€™t be used to pay speakers or organizers.
- Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
- Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

### Utilizing your local WordPress Meetup group

"Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community."

With this in mind you are able to schedule a meetup via your local meetup group.

##### Coordinate with existing organizers

Communication will alleviate overlap and facilitate an open dialogue about your new meetup event. The meetup events should be free of competition and should further community growth.

##### There isn't a local group with in 60mi of my home

### Meeting with Others

This will be your largest hurdle. Think of it like a blind business date. You know you share common interests, you know there is potential for great things, but will your interests and potentials align with other you meet?

1. Don't stop, Don't give up
2. Others are in the same boat
3. Fill the boat so full that eventually you do find the people you are looking for.
4. As you're filling the boat be sure to remind others on the boat of 1, 2 & 3.

### Choosing a Location

- Start easy
- Stay public
- Keep it free
- Look within your neighborhood
- Ask within you industry

### Choosing a Topic

I suggest choosing a topic based on a few factors. 

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Curiosities
